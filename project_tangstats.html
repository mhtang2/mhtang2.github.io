				<h2>About Tang Stats</h2>
				<p>
					<a href="https://mhtang2.github.io/TangStats" target="_blank">Tang Stats</a> was the result of a
					freelance job offered to
					me in early
					2020 by Groger Ranks, a QuizBowl organization planning to host a tournament that was interested in
					software to keep track of advanced statistics for each team, player, round of the tournament, etc.
					The
					desktop app is written using plain Java and Swing, with the licensing server written with Node.js
					and
					MongoDB. After completing the project I decided to try to market this product to other tournament
					hosts
					so I created a website promoting and documenting the software.

					Reflecting on my experience writing this app, I would definitely do some things differently if I
					could
					rewrite it. For one, Java Swing is clunky and frankly outdated - I would probably use something a
					bit
					more modern and robust like React or Electron.
