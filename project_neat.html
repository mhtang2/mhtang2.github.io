				<h2>About NEAT</h2>
				<p>NEAT (Neuroevolution through Augmenting Topologies) is a genetic algorithm which trains agents in a
					way
					that mimics biological evolution. Rather than optimizing a single agent, there is actually a
					popoulation
					of agents. The most fit of the population are allowed to reproduce, while the others die off.
					Selectively breeding the most fit networks will eventually lead to populations with higher and
					higher
					fitnesses. My friend and I found it fascinating and implemented the algorithm based on this
					<a href="http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf">paper</a>. The innovation from
					this method
					is
					that it utilizes non-dense networks, and evolves the topology of the network rather than only the
					weights and biases. The coolest idea in this paper is how the topology of the network can be stored
					in
					genes and perform crossover during reproduction just as in real life genetics. It also talks about
					the
					idea of speciation: splitting the population into isolated species that are allowed time to develop
					features that may be detrimental in the short run but eventually lead to a larger performance gain.
					Speciation allows these features to develop by separating the species and giving them a grace period
					before competing with the general population.
				</p>
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>
					We managed to get a fully working implementation that learned XOR effectively. We also tried to
					train
					and agent to trade stocks, which unfortunately barely outperformed random trading.</p>
